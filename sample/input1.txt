Larry: We have called today's meeting to talk about the marketing strategies that we should  be employing for the launch of our new product.
Jane: I have an idea.
Larry: Please go ahead, Jane.
Jane: We should have a contest.
Larry: What kind of contest?
Jane: A social media contest.
Larry: Sounds interesting. Could you elaborate on it?
Jane: We can have a hashtag and people can post pictures of themselves using our product. We can  then pick a winner and give them a prize.
Larry: That sounds like a great idea. Let's do it.
